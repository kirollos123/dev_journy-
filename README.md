# Dev Journey

🚀 Dev Joury – Core Programming Mastery (C++ & Python)

This repository is a structured collection of my journey in mastering the core fundamentals of programming, including:

    ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    ✅ Data Structures & Algorithms

    ✅ Problem Solving

    ✅ Design Patterns

    ✅ Project-Based Learning

Languages: C++ (primary) & Python (secondary)
🎯 Objectives

    Build strong foundations in OOP and algorithmic thinking.

    Solve real-world problems using C++ and Python.

    Learn and implement common design patterns.

    Create structured and scalable codebases.

    Prepare for software engineering interviews and system design
